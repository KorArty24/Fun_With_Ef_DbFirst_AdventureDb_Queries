# Fun_With_Ef_DbFirst_AdventureDb_Queries
This is the reversed engineered version of the Micosoft's demo AdventureWorks database. I reversed engineered it to create Entity Framework model and DbContext. 
The aim of that is to create a sandbox for writing and experimenting with dbqueries in EntityFramework and LINQ.
Download your own copy of AdventureWorks, restore it to SQL Serv database, adjust the connection string and play.
